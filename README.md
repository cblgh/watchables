# watchables
gets things for me to watch when i dunno what to watch

create a file called `watchables.txt`   
put one thing that you want to watch per line  
run the script to get a thing

# don't forget
* pyperclip is a dependency
* you'll need a watchables.txt in the same directory
* to run it

# is it good
yes
